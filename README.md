`it’s Mid Project for Epsilon AI Diploma i Make a Deep Analysis Project to Scrape YouTube data using YouTube Data API. `,<br>
 `I extract the data and then load this data into a Python Pandas DataFrame and then Analyze this data.` <br>
    `Finally, we build simple visualization from this data using the Python Seaborn and ploty library.` <br>
## **Introduction**

Hello ! My name is Mohamed Eisa just call me (0xnrous), this is my second public notebook Deep Analysis 

I'm planning to go through feature (question) by feature and take closer look those features.<br>
So it's gonna take a while to finish this notebook with all features involved.<br>
I'm planning to update it regulary whenever I have free time. <br>
I'll answer each important question first and give a summary in the Final section.<br><br>
`English is not my native language, so sorry for gramatical errors or similar.`<br><br>
