`it’s Mid Project for Epsilon AI Diploma i Make a Deep Analysis Project to Scrape YouTube data using YouTube Data API. `,<br>
 `I extract the data and then load this data into a Python Pandas DataFrame and then Analyze this data.` <br>
    `Finally, we build simple visualization from this data using the Python Seaborn and ploty library.` <br>
## **Introduction**

Hello ! My name is Mohamed Eisa just call me (0xnrous), this is my second public notebook Deep Analysis 

I'm planning to go through feature (question) by feature and take closer look those features.<br>
So it's gonna take a while to finish this notebook with all features involved.<br>
I'm planning to update it regulary whenever I have free time. <br>
I'll answer each important question first and give a summary in the Final section.<br><br>
`English is not my native language, so sorry for gramatical errors or similar.`<br><br>

`This Data is Genterated from YouTube API in[ `06/08/2023` ]so every video will added to channels we show new result` <br><br>

<span style="color:#47917f">Questions</span><br><br>

##  **CONCLUSION FOR DROOS ONLINE CHANNEL 📕 (Insights)**:

####  How to Increase video CTR ، Interaction and Subscription Ratio :
 
`- Use more action verbs.` <br><br>
`- Best CTR titles used in the channel are “تعلم ”, "وصايا”, “مذاكرة ، “نصائح ”` 
`, “ اسهل” ,“شرح”, “ فقط” , “ اقل ” ، “كيف ”  related to most of top 10 videos of views , likes and Comments` <br><br>
`- Some Words to avoid to used in Channel are “التحميل”  ، “ ادوات” “مشكلة”` <br><br>
`- Try to make a clean thumbnail with text color light (white,yellow,skyblue) over bloded colors because it get good clicked on` <br><br>
`- Avoid low CTR titles that are about: lives and Q&A` <br><br>
`- Avoid color red in text over dark.` <br><br>
`- Don’t put multiple objects that saturate the thumbnail.` <br><br>
`- Don’t making Videos about tut for Windows Programm like IDM or any thing related` <br><br>
> `Using emojis is almost scarce. One or two can be more attractive that only plain text.`
